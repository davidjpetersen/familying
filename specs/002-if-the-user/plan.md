## Summary
Primary requirement: Enable users without family organizations to create families using Clerk's organization system, and provide organization profile management in user settings. Technical approach: Leverage Clerk Organizations API for family management, implement conditional navigation based on organization membership, and create settings interface for organization profile management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Next.js 15.x, React 19  
**Primary Dependencies**: @clerk/nextjs, Clerk Organizations API, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI  
**Storage**: Clerk's organization storage (no additional database needed)  
**Testing**: Jest unit tests, Playwright E2E tests, React Testing Library integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design)  
**Project Type**: web (Next.js app with authentication integration)  
**Performance Goals**: <2.0s LCP on 3G conditions per constitution  
**Constraints**: Must comply with WCAG 2.2 AA, privacy-first design, family-safe interface  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-tenant family organizations, organization-aware routing, settings integration

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (Next.js app with integrated components)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Next.js, Clerk, Radix UI directly)
- Single data model? Yes (Family Organization via Clerk Organizations)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct API calls, no unnecessary abstraction layers)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Components and utilities as reusable modules
- Libraries listed: 
  - family-org-detection (check user organization status)
  - family-creation-flow (handle family setup process)  
  - org-settings-manager (manage organization profile)
- CLI per library: N/A (web application components)
- Library docs: Component documentation in JSDoc format

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (tests written before implementation)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Required workflow
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (actual Clerk API calls in integration tests)
- Integration tests for: Organization detection, creation flow, settings management
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Console logging for development, analytics for user actions
- Frontend logs → backend? Via Clerk analytics and custom tracking
- Error context sufficient? Error boundaries and detailed error messages

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 002.001.000 (feature.iteration.build)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Migration from non-org to org-based navigation

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Next.js app structure) - web application with integrated authentication

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Identified:
1. **Clerk Organizations API capabilities**: How to detect user organization membership
2. **Clerk CreateOrganization component**: Integration patterns and customization options  
3. **Clerk Organization Profile**: Available settings and management features
4. **Navigation patterns**: Conditional routing based on organization status
5. **Testing strategies**: How to test Clerk integration in development

### Research Findings Consolidated:

#### Clerk Organizations API
- **Decision**: Use Clerk's native organization system for family management
- **Rationale**: Built-in user management, roles, permissions, and security
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom database tables (rejected due to complexity and security concerns)

#### Family Creation Flow
- **Decision**: Use Clerk's CreateOrganization component with custom styling
- **Rationale**: Handles all organization creation logic, validation, and persistence
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom forms (rejected due to reinventing secure workflows)

#### Organization Detection
- **Decision**: Use Clerk's useOrganizationList hook for membership detection
- **Rationale**: Real-time updates, handles edge cases like invitations
- **Alternatives considered**: Server-side checks only (rejected due to UX delays)

#### Settings Integration
- **Decision**: Embed Clerk's OrganizationProfile in settings section
- **Rationale**: Provides complete management interface with consistent security
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom settings form (rejected due to feature gaps)

**Output**: ✓ research.md with all technical decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model (Clerk Organizations)
- **Family Organization**: Managed by Clerk (name, slug, metadata, member list)
- **User Membership**: Managed by Clerk (user ID, organization ID, role)
- **Organization Profile**: Managed by Clerk (settings, preferences, member management)

### API Contracts (Clerk Integration)
- Organization detection: `useOrganizationList()` hook
- Family creation: `<CreateOrganization>` component
- Settings management: `<OrganizationProfile>` component
- Navigation guards: Custom hooks for conditional routing

### Contract Tests
- Organization detection returns correct status
- Family creation flow completes successfully
- Settings interface loads organization data
- Navigation redirects work properly

### Integration Tests
- User without organization sees creation interface
- User with organization can access settings
- Family creation updates navigation state
- Settings changes persist correctly

### Component Tests
- CreateFamilyForm renders correctly for non-members
- OrganizationProfile renders correctly for members
- Navigation shows appropriate links based on status
- Error states handle Clerk API failures

**Output**: ✓ data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md updated

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each Clerk integration → contract test task [P]
- Each component → component creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Utilities before components before pages
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - simple, direct implementation using Clerk's built-in features*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS - PENDING
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
