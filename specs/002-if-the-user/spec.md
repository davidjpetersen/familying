# Feature Specification: Family Organization Management

**Feature Branch**: `002-if-the-user`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "If the user doesn't belong to an organization, have a page for creating a family. Use clerk's CreateOrganization. Add the Organization Profile as a page to the user's settings."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: family creation, organization management, user settings
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: authenticated users, family members
   ‚Üí Actions: create family, manage organization, access settings
   ‚Üí Data: family organization, user roles, settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: user must be authenticated, organization-based access
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: non-member creates family, member manages settings
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Family Organization, User Membership, Organization Profile
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some clarifications needed for user roles and permissions
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user who is not currently part of any family organization needs to create a new family to manage household activities, meal planning, and family resources. Once part of a family, they should be able to access and manage their family organization settings through their user profile.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is logged in and has no family organization, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they should see an option to create a new family
2. **Given** a user chooses to create a family, **When** they provide family details and submit, **Then** a new family organization is created and they become the owner
3. **Given** a user is part of a family organization, **When** they access their settings, **Then** they should see an organization profile management option
4. **Given** a user accesses organization profile settings, **When** they make changes, **Then** the family organization information is updated
5. **Given** a user is not part of any organization, **When** they access organization profile settings, **Then** they should be redirected to create a family first

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create multiple families simultaneously?
- How does system handle family creation with duplicate names?
- What occurs if user loses internet connection during family creation?
- How does system behave when user is invited to multiple families during creation process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect if authenticated user belongs to any family organization
- **FR-002**: System MUST display family creation interface for users without family membership
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to create new family organizations with basic information (name, description)
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically assign family creator as organization owner with full permissions
- **FR-005**: System MUST redirect users to their dashboard after successful family creation
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide organization profile management interface in user settings
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow family organization owners to modify organization details
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent unauthorized users from accessing organization management features
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist family organization data and user membership relationships
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle navigation appropriately based on user's organization membership status

*Clarifications needed:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: can users belong to multiple families, or maximum one?]
- **FR-012**: Family creation MUST require [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what minimum information - just name, or additional details?]
- **FR-013**: Organization profile MUST allow editing of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific fields can be modified?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle family member permissions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what roles/permissions exist beyond owner?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Family Organization**: Represents a household unit with name, description, creation date, and owner information
- **User Membership**: Links users to family organizations with role-based permissions (owner, member, etc.)
- **Organization Profile**: Contains family organization settings, preferences, and member management capabilities
