## User Journey 3: Navigation Flow Validation

### Steps

1. **Test Conditional Navigation**
   - Sign in as user without organization
   - **Expected**: Logo links to `/` (homepage)
   - Switch to user with organization
   - **Expected**: Logo links to `/dashboard`

2. **Test Route Guards**
   - Access `/settings/organization` without organization
   - **Expected**: Redirect to create family flow
   - Access with organization membership
   - **Expected**: Settings page loads successfully

3. **Test Navigation State Updates**
   - Create organization in one browser tab
   - **Expected**: Navigation updates in other tabs
   - **Test**: Real-time state synchronization works

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Navigation adapts to organization membership
- [ ] Route guards protect organization-specific pages
- [ ] State updates propagate across browser tabs
- [ ] Loading states handled gracefully

## Performance Validation

### Metrics to Check

1. **Page Load Performance**
   ```bash
   # Open Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse
   # Test /dashboard page load
   # Target: LCP < 2.0s on 3G simulation
   ```

2. **Organization Data Loading**
   - Time from navigation to data display
   - **Target**: < 500ms for organization detection
   - **Target**: < 1000ms for full organization profile load

3. **Component Render Performance**
   - CreateOrganization component mount time
   - OrganizationProfile component render time
   - **Target**: < 100ms for initial render

### Performance Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard loads within performance targets
- [ ] Organization data fetches efficiently
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders during navigation
- [ ] Clerk hooks don't cause performance regressions

## Error Handling Validation

### Test Scenarios

1. **Network Failures**
   - Disconnect network during family creation
   - **Expected**: Appropriate error message shown
   - **Test**: Retry mechanism works when network returns

2. **Invalid Data Handling**
   - Submit family creation with invalid name
   - **Expected**: Client-side validation prevents submission
   - **Test**: Server-side validation handles edge cases

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Non-admin tries to access admin functions
   - **Expected**: Permission denied message
   - **Test**: User gracefully redirected or shown fallback

### Error Handling Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- [ ] Permission errors show helpful messages
- [ ] Error boundaries prevent app crashes

   // Test organization retrieval
   const orgs = await clerk.getOrganizationList();
   
   // Test organization updates
   await clerk.updateOrganization(org.id, { name: "Updated Family" });
   ```

2. **Real-time Updates**
